This was the final project in Module 4 at Turing School of Software & Design. The project description can be found here: [Project Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

## Project Description

Our goal was to build real time applications with WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients. I used Node and Express to create a polling app.

## Learning Goals

* Build a rich web application that leverages WebSockets to push data to connected clients in real time.
* Leverage simple data structures to manage the state of your application.
* Evaluate the trade-offs involved in different approaches and make informed decisions about your application's design and architecture.
